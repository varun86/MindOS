# Privacy Policy — MindOS Web Clipper

**Last updated:** April 2025

## Overview

MindOS Web Clipper is a browser extension that saves web pages and supported AI chat sessions to your local MindOS knowledge base. It is designed with privacy as a core principle.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No browsing history is tracked
- No analytics or telemetry is sent
- No cookies are set by the extension
- No data is transmitted to any external server

## Data Storage

The extension stores only two pieces of information locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API:

1. **MindOS URL** — The address of your local MindOS instance (e.g., `http://localhost:3456`)
2. **Auth Token** — A token you provide to authenticate with your local MindOS instance

This data never leaves your device and is only used to communicate with your own MindOS instance running on your local network.

## Data Transmission

When you clip a web page or supported AI chat session, the extension:

1. Reads the content of the current browser tab (only when you explicitly click "Save")
2. Converts the page content or conversation transcript to Markdown format
3. Sends the Markdown to your local MindOS instance via HTTP

**All communication is between your browser and your own computer.** No data is sent to any third-party server, cloud service, or external API.

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why it's needed |

| `activeTab` | Read the current page or AI chat content when you click "Save" |
